### ðŸ”¹ðŸ”¹About

This is a mobile web application where users can chat with others in the same place, and also send private messages to someone. Below are the implemented features:

- Home page where users enter in the chat-room with using an username;
- Chat page where users can send messagens to one another;
- Page with a sidebar where users can choose to send a message to a specific other user and if it will private or not;<br><br>
  _Business rule:_ <br>
  One's username can not be equal to any other's in the room; <br>
  Private messages can be seen only by their sender or their receiver; <br>
  Automatic scroll to shows always the most updated message in the bottom; <br>
  Users can send a private message to all - just because it's cool! <br>

### ðŸ”¹ðŸ”¹Disclaimer
The API used in this project were given by https://mock-api.bootcamp.respondeai.com.br/api/v3/uol <br><br>
I made this project while I was learning javascript and it was my first time working with an API, sendind and receiving requests.<br> 
The API cheks if an user is active in the room every 15 seconds, so I keep sending requests every 10 seconds to API to keep users in the chat.<br>
